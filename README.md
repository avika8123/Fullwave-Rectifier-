Full Wave Rectifier

Description:
A full wave rectifier converts AC (Alternating Current) to DC (Direct Current) by using both halves of the AC cycle. It is more efficient than a half-wave rectifier and produces a smoother DC output, especially when followed by a filter capacitor.

Types:

Center-tapped rectifier: Uses 2 diodes and a center-tap transformer.

Bridge rectifier: Uses 4 diodes and does not need a center-tap.


Key Components:

2 or 4 Diodes

Filter capacitor (for smoothing the output)


Applications:
Used in power supplies for electronics, battery chargers, and DC-powered systems.
